# Runningbuddy Calculations

The service provides the most popular calculations in terms of pace, distance and times for runners. It currently supports kilometers and minuters per kilometers as units, with a planned implementation for miles and minutes per mile. 

The service is separated into a backend API written in Node TypeScript and a frontend written in React TypeScript. The primary goal for this project is to learn TypeScript and Node, and improve my React skills. 

# Backend
The backend of the service is created with NodeJS, written in TypeScript and compiled to a JavaScript file that is executed. 

The service serves the following endpoints:

* `pace-calculator/distances`
* `pace-calculator/specified-distance`
